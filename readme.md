⚙️ Key Learning Areas
🔹 1. Azure AI Foundry (formerly OpenAI Studio)
Overview of workspace, resources, and endpoints
Model deployment & endpoint configuration
Using playground for prompt experimentation
Model fine-tuning basics and deployment governance
🔹 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Embeddings generation (text-embedding-ada-002)
Vector database storage (FAISS, Chroma, Qdrant, or Azure Cognitive Search)
Retrieve → Combine → Generate pattern
Evaluating context precision and recall
🔹 3. Security & Governance
Azure role-based access control (RBAC)
Token management and usage monitoring
Compliance with Responsible AI principles
